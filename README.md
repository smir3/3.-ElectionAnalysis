# ElectionAnalysisAssignment

Overview of Election Audit

Purpose:
Tom is a Colorado Board of Election Employee. His manager, Seth, wants to know if there is a way to automate the election results analysis process using Python. I am tasked with assisting Tom in creating a vote count report to certify this U.S congretional race. This report will be used for congretional districts, senatorial districts, and local elections. 

Task deliverables:
There are 3 primary voting methods that Tom will take into account; mail-in ballots (hand counted), punch cards (machine counted), and direct recording electronic (computer counted). These will determine the total election results. The task is to use Python to determine the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, the winner of the election, the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout.
